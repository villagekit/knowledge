## Mikey:
### am thinking Roam is a better way for us to both keep track of the emerging knowledge and write rough "dev diaries" as we go
#### Roam is the latest hype at least, so while $15/month is expensive, and open-source-for-the-win, maybe worth seeing what the buzz is about
##### TiddlyWiki and Foam were the most promising self-hosted alternatives i found

##### i think reducing the barriers to us publishing our thoughts is worthwhile

### trying to learn how to use Roam...
#### everything is a list of a list :grimacing:

#### okay, ctrl+alt+# to change header
