## A pattern is a clear description of a reusable and interoperable [[building block]].
## Our hypothesis is that a few top-down standardized interfaces will best support bottom-up stigmergic ecosystems.
us on living, the relevant systems include:
## Physical
### [[Structure]]
### [[Energy]]
### [[Heat]]
### [[Fluids]]
## Socio-economic
### [[Ownership]]
### [[Stewardship]]
## More information will arise as we make progress with our prototypes, stay tuned.
