title: Patterns
---

## A pattern is a clear description of a reusable and interoperable [[building block]].

## We are developing open source [[Patterns]] for every facet of living infrastructure, where each pattern focuses on making one thing more friendly.

## Our hypothesis is that a few top-down standardized interfaces will best support bottom-up stigmergic ecosystems.

## [[Patterns]]
### With an initial focus on living, the relevant systems include:

### Physical
#### [[Grid]]

#### [[Energy]]

#### [[Heat]]

#### [[Fluids]]

### Socio-economic
#### [[Ownership]]

#### [[Stewardship]]

### More information will arise as we make progress with our prototypes, stay tuned.
